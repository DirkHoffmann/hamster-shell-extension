Hacking
========

One of the great challenges developing or contributing to a *GNOME-Shell*
extension is the lack of documentation for it.
In order to be as inviting as possible and to allow you to get hacking on
*Hamster-Shell-Extension* without dwelling all to deep in the muddy waters of
*GNOME-Shell* development we aim to do two things.

#. Highlight those parts of the code that are closely coupled with specific
   parts of the *GNOME-Shell* framework. This way you have a good idea if there
   are hidden constrains to be considered or if "what you see is what you get".
#. Provide some references and bits and pieces about various aspects of
   *GNOME-Shell* development in general. This is particularly helpful if you
   actually need to interact with the shell framework to get you work done.

  I could find. While not perfect it provides a most useful starting point if you know what kind of widget/feature you want
  but not where to find it. Or of cause, if you want to know where to find out more about this obscure
